# üîê BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Dashboard

A simple interactive dashboard built with Streamlit and Qiskit to simulate the BB84 protocol, compare it with classical key exchange methods, and visualize quantum cryptography in action.

## Features

- BB84 quantum key distribution (with or without eavesdropping)
- Streamlit-powered user interface
- Planned extensions: RSA simulation, error-rate comparison, and visualizations

## Run Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
